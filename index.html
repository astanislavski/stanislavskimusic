        <h2>Out now!</h2>
        <p>If you have ever played in a big band, you’ll know how confusing the notation is. With rhythms written above the stave, strange diagonal slashes and notated drum parts that don’t make sense, it can be very difficult to know where to start. Furthermore, for those taking on the style for the first time the genre lacks materials appropriate for beginners. This frustration is where The Beginner’s Guide to Big Band Drumming arose from.
        Written by Melbourne drummer Anthony Stanislavski, the book addresses the challenges of reading, short and long note orchestrations, saxophone, trumpet, or trombone section figures, ensemble figures and how to tackle rests and fills, turning them into playable phrases that fit stylistically within a piece with well thought out exercises presented in a logical format.</p>

                  "I’d been satisfied with my Sibelius skills in scoring all my compositions for over a decade, but as my music began demanding new ways of scoring, I found I was no longer equipped with the necessary notational skills to realise them. A Sibelius skills session with Anthony Stanislavski fixed this! Anthony was fantastic at working through practical solutions with me, and resolving all my Sibelius questions. Highly recommended!"

Based on Anthony's very effective mini brush lessons on Facebook, I wanted to give his "Beginner's Guide to Big Band Drumming" a try. Well, the verdict is in: Anthony methodically lays out bite-size exercises with various tempo backing tracks that are both fun and very effective. He also has a couple of charts that combine everything learned in these exercises to these big band tunes."
